The two files in the `/Rcmdr' directory of urca, namely `Rcmdr-urca.R' 
and `Rcmdr-menus.txt', can be utilisied as an add-in to `Rcmdr' of
John Fox. For more information on `Rcmdr' please visit the URL:

	http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/

as well as the man pages of the package itself. Incidentally, a
tutorial `Getting-Started-with-the-Rcmdr.pdf' is shipped in the
`/doc' subdirectory of `Rcmdr'.

In order to install the `urca' add-in to `Rcmdr' two steps are
necessary:

1. step:
********
Copy the `Rcmdr-urca.R' into the `/etc' sub-directory of the package
`Rcmdr'; that is: `Rcmdr/etc' should now contain this file.

2. step:
********
Copy the contents of the file `Rcmdr-menus.txt' in the `urca/inst'
directory into the file `Rcmdr/etc/Rcmdr-menus.txt' at a suitable
place. For example, you can place the contents right before the 
definition of the `Help-menu' (look for a line, similar to:

	menu  helpMenu  topMenu   ""  ""  ""

Then, the newly created `urca-menu' will be placed left to the
`Help-menu' of `Rcmdr' once you executed: library(Rcmdr) from a 
R Console.
